# Tufte's Viz Fundamentals

A few years back, I found a four-pack of Tufte books at King's Books in Tacoma - one of the best used bookstore finds I've made!  Buried within the book "Beautiful Evidence", Tufte finally condenses his work into six fundamental principles of data visualization.  Here they are, with my own spin:  

1. **Show comparisons.**  Visualizations should help the viewer make comparisons â€” over time, between groups, across categories, etc.  When making a vizualization, think about what is being compared to what.  If the time trend is important, highlight the trend.  If the comparison of two lines is important, make sure they can be compared on the same scale.  If we are showing that a value is abnormal, then we need to present the mean value as well, so that we can see the deviation.

2. **Provide insight.**  Tufte uses the phrase "show causality," which I think is a bit mechanistic.  I like to think of it as "provide insight."  What is that main point that the reader will learn from this graphic?  What is the new understanding that they will walk away with?  What is the question that is answered by the graphic? If a picture is worth a thousand words, what are those thousand words? 

3. **Show multivariate data.**  Real-world phenomena often involve many variables. Good graphics reveal multiple dimensions of data simultaneously.  Do not shy away from adding another layer to your plot by adding another dimension, provided there is an interesting insight to be gained.  Readers love to think in many dimensions.    

4. **Integrate evidence.**  Tufte recommends that we combine words, numbers, and images in a coherent, unified graphic. This is more of an art than a science.  In practice, this means that if additional labels, lines, annotations, and colors can help to deliver the core insights of the graphic, then we should take the time to add them.  On the other hand, data or labels that do not provide additional insight should be removed.   

5. **Describe and document the evidence.**  Provide clear sourcing and context so that viewers can judge the credibility and relevance of the data.  Attribution is always a good thing.  

6. **Content counts most of all.**  The most beautiful chart is worthless without meaningful content. The strength of the data matter more than aesthetics.
